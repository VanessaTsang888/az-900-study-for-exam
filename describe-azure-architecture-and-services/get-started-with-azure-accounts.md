# Get started with Azure Accounts

To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When you're completing Learn modules, most of the time a temporary subscription is created for you, which runs in an environment called the Learn sandbox. When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you. After you've created an Azure account, you're free to create additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments. After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.

Diagram:

1. Azure Account: a user.
2. Subscriptions: keys or crendials to login to my user account.
3. Resource Groups: different resource groups I have to use.
4. Resources: different resources I have to use.

If you're new to Azure, you can sign up for a free account on the Azure website to start exploring at no cost to you. When you're ready, you can choose to upgrade your free account. You can also create a new subscription that enables you to start paying for Azure services you need beyond the limits of a free account.

You can purchase Azure access directly from Microsoft by signing up on the Azure website or through a Microsoft representative. You can also purchase Azure access through a Microsoft partner. Cloud Solution Provider partners offer a range of complete managed-cloud solutions for Azure.

Sign up for a free Azure account which includes 20 free products for 12 months. Plus, $200 credit free to spend on my first 30 days. For more info: azure.microsoft.com/free

I pay for only what I use each month without any upfront commitments. Once I have Azure account I may want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes. If I have multi subscription I can organise them into invoice sections.

As part of my subscription I have 24 hours access to documentations, community support and new Azure capabilities demo videos created by Azure engineers. for more info on support available: docs.microsoft.com

## What is the Azure free account?

The Azure free student account offer includes:

Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months.
A credit to use in the first 12 months.
Free access to certain software developer tools.
The [Azure free student account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/students/) is an offer for students that gives $100 credit and free developer tools. Also, you can sign up without a credit card.

Many of the Learn exercises use a technology called the sandbox, which creates a temporary subscription that's added to your Azure account. This temporary subscription allows you to create Azure resources during a Learn module. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you've completed the module.

When you're completing a Learn module, you're welcome to use your personal subscription to complete the exercises in a module. However, the sandbox is the preferred method to use because it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost to you.

Van: This sounds safe for me to learn without worrying about getting charged unexpectingly. Very happy with this safety net from Microsoft üëåüôåüëèüòé
