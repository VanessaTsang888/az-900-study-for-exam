Software as a service (SaaS) is the **_most complete cloud service model_** from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.

While the SaaS model may be the **_least flexible_**, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.

## Shared responsibility model

The shared responsibility model applies to all the cloud service types. SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user. In a SaaS environment you’re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access. Nearly everything else falls to the cloud provider. The cloud provider is responsible for physical security of the datacenters, power, network connectivity, and <mark>application development</mark> and patching.

### Vaneessa's research

Dynamics is an Microsoft example of SaaS. Microsoft provide Dynamics as SaaS. They fix bugs, add features, do security fixes. The customer just adds users, enters data and uses the software.

### Vanessa's thoughts

At the moment I feel this is the most expensive option but suited to smaller businesses who don't wish to deal with too much teachie work?
