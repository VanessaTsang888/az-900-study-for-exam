# What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as ***virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking***. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like *Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)*.

Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

### My summary

It is virtual rather than phyical. We only pay for the services we use. If we wish we can deligate the up-keep of the computer or service.
Each cloud provide will have their own selection of services. The basic services provided by all cloud providers are ***Compute power*** and ***Storage***.

Comput power is how much processing my computer can do. With cloud computing, We can add and remove power as needed. This saves on costs since we only pay for resources we use.

Storage is the volume of data we can store in our computer. A traditional computer has limit storage and over time we may need to buy another HD to store more data. With cloud computing, we can request more storage as we need it. With cloud providers they manage the up-keep of the computer so we don't have to. They will make sure there are back-ups of our data, that the OS is up-to-date, as well as making sure everything is running 24 hours a day. Therefore as our organisation grows, we can <mark>bring in new computing resources in a cost effetive way</mark> which is great forus since we are having to  work with very limited funding and will be for a while.
