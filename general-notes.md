# General Notes

These are very general notes such as resources I am using to completed my studying or learning for the AZ-900 Certification.

## Resources

For my notes I am using the markdown syntax and particularly the below two:

- [Markdown Cheat Sheet - basic](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/cheat-sheet/)
- [Markdown Cheat Sheet - extended](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/)

**_Markdown Cheat Sheet - extended_**

Highlight:
For the Highlight I've tried the two signs (==) before and after the words, but no luck. This is why I am using the mark html tag in stead.
